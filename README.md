# Dog Cat Classifier using convolutional neural networks


This project was done as a class assignment and we were tasked to build a CNN  model to correctly classifier animals as dog or cat.
To use this code, clone the repo either via your terminal (ctrl +Alt + T) and write "git clone https://github.com/KANUBALAD/Cat_Dog_Classifier.git. 
Once this is done downloading, you run main.py 

You could also directly clone the repo on my github page and then saving it in your desired local directory and running main.py

# NOTE
Pease ensure you have all the requirements properly installed by looking at the requirements.txt file before running the main.py file
